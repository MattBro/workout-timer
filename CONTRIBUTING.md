3. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   pnpm test
   ```

4. **Run type checking**
   ```bash
   pnpm typecheck

```

### Code Style Guidelines

#### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Provide proper types (avoid `any`)
- Use interfaces over type aliases when possible
- Export types that might be useful for consumers

```typescript
// Good
export interface TimerConfig {
  duration: number;
  countdown?: number;
}

// Avoid
export type TimerConfig = {
  duration: any;
}
```

#### React

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Use proper prop types
- Memoize expensive computations

```tsx
// Good
export const TimerDisplay: React.FC<TimerDisplayProps> = memo(({ time, state }) => {
  const formattedTime = useMemo(() => formatTime(time), [time]);
  
  return <div>{formattedTime}</div>;
});

// Avoid
export function TimerDisplay(props) {
  return <div>{formatTime(props.time)}</div>;
}
```

#### General

- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility)
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Avoid magic numbers - use constants

```typescript
// Good
const DEFAULT_COUNTDOWN_SECONDS = 10;
const MINUTE_IN_SECONDS = 60;

/**
 * Formats seconds into MM:SS format
 * @param seconds - Total seconds to format
 * @returns Formatted time string
 */
export function formatTime(seconds: number): string {
  const minutes = Math.floor(seconds / MINUTE_IN_SECONDS);
  const remainingSeconds = seconds % MINUTE_IN_SECONDS;
  return `${minutes.toString().padStart(2, '0')}:${remainingSeconds.toString().padStart(2, '0')}`;
}

// Avoid
export function fmt(s) {
  return `${Math.floor(s/60)}:${s%60}`;
}
```

### Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Ensure existing tests pass
- Aim for good test coverage
- Use descriptive test names

```typescript
// Good
describe('AMRAPTimer', () => {
  it('should start with idle state', () => {
    const timer = new AMRAPTimer({ duration: 300 });
    expect(timer.getSnapshot().state).toBe(TimerState.IDLE);
  });

  it('should count up when running', () => {
    // test implementation
  });
});

// Avoid
test('timer works', () => {
  // unclear test
});
```

### Commit Message Guidelines

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). Each commit message should have the format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

#### Types

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that don't affect code meaning (formatting, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: Code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or dependencies
- **ci**: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- **chore**: Other changes that don't modify src or test files

#### Examples

```bash
# Feature
git commit -m "feat(core): add countdown support to all timer types"

# Bug fix
git commit -m "fix(react): prevent memory leak in useTimer hook"

# Documentation
git commit -m "docs: update installation instructions for yarn users"

# Breaking change
git commit -m "feat(core): change Timer API to use milliseconds

BREAKING CHANGE: Timer.duration now expects milliseconds instead of seconds"
```
